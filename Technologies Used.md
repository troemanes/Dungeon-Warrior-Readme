<h3 align="start"><strong>Features and Plans</strong></h3>

1. <p align="start">Using a random name generation algorithm, I’ve designed unique and atmospheric enemies that players will encounter only once, enhancing immersion in the game world. With the help of AI, I’ve incorporated suitable images and their corresponding backstories, while also creating thematic music that aligns with the different elements of the game.</p>

2. <p align="start">Leveraging Jetpack Compose Animations, I developed engaging battle animations and provided players with a detailed battle summary in the game’s end screen. Players can trade and equip over 25 items, each with unique attributes that significantly impact gameplay. This system allows players to experience varied strategies and gameplay styles.</p>

3. <p align="start">I introduced diverse game modes to ensure a fresh and engaging experience, moving away from monotonous, single-style gameplay. These modes will continue to expand with future updates, offering even more content for players to enjoy.</p>

4. <p align="start">With upcoming updates, the technologies used in this game will evolve further. Monetization features will also be introduced to generate revenue, supporting the development of more ambitious games and applications with higher budgets in the future.</p>

5. <p align="start">I used WorkManager for background tasks and stored that data using SharedPreferences.</p>

6. <p align="start">I used Coroutines for asynchronous functions to improve performance and handle background operations efficiently.</p>

7. <p align="start">I utilized the ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, ensuring the data survives configuration changes like screen rotations.</p>

8. <p align="start">I integrated the Navigation Component to handle in-app navigation seamlessly, making it easier to navigate between different screens and manage their back stack.</p>
